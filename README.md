It uses an in-memory list to store User objects and exposes RESTful endpoints to interact with these users. The key functionalities include adding a user, retrieving user details, retrieving all users, updating user information, and deleting a user by their ID.While this code provides a basic foundation for managing user data, it lacks several important features necessary for a production-grade application, such as validation, error handling, and data persistence. In a real-world scenario, you would typically integrate with a database and implement proper error handling and validation to ensure data integrity and security.
